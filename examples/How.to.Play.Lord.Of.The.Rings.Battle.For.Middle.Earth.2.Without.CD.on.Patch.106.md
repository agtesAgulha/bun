# How to Play Lord Of The Rings Battle For Middle Earth 2 Without CD on Patch 1.06
 
Lord Of The Rings Battle For Middle Earth 2 (BFME2) is a popular real-time strategy game based on the fantasy novels by J.R.R. Tolkien. However, if you want to play the game on patch 1.06, which is the latest official version, you may encounter a problem: the game requires you to insert the CD-ROM every time you launch it. This can be annoying and inconvenient, especially if you have lost or damaged your CD-ROM, or if you want to play the game on a laptop without a CD drive.

Fortunately, there is a way to play BFME2 without CD on patch 1.06. You will need to download and install a few files, such as a no-CD patch, a patch switcher, and a fixer for Windows 10. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Download the game. You can either download a vanilla BFME2 ISO file from one of these links: [Mirror #1](http://www.mediafire.com/file/4heo0ipvahha...fMe_II.iso/file) or [Mirror #2](https://mega.nz/file/lrx0kbpK#tqaPysq6ILAo0...Lp3pzK37sofLeFE). This option comes with all the game features, including World-builder and supports all available languages for the game. However, it weighs 4GB, it will ask you for an original copy key, and there may be a crash when trying to launch it on Windows 10 for the first time. Alternatively, you can download BFME2 Special Edition from this link: [BFME2 Special Edition](http://forshire.blogspot.com/p/download-bfme-ii.html). This option is easier and faster to install, weighs only 2GB, doesn't need mounting, fixes the crash at startup and has new music from The Hobbit. However, it is ripped which means certain game features & assets are deleted, such as non-english support files or World-builder. Another problem is that it comes with an old patch 1.07 version.
2. Install the game with a random generated serial key. You can download a key generator from this link: [Key Generator](https://mega.nz/file/Nuxy2CZD#miSm0t4BLwTmO...QQ0I9tFfq1bsd5g). Copy a key number for vanilla BFME2 installation.
3. Install the Patch Switcher. You can download GameReplays's Latest BFME2 1.09 version & Switcher from one of these links: [Mirror #1](https://mega.nz/file/JrhCAb7A#h9xPAmUUKLZSp...ZS2LmN77LLK0Gvg) or [Mirror #2](https://www.mediafire.com/file/pdkpsk3yfzsc...ler%20%284%29.rar/file). The Switcher for BFMEII Patch 1.09v2.0 has cracks for every version integrated.
4. Fix the game for Windows 10 (This is not necessary if you downloaded BFME2's Special Edition). If your game crashes in any version, run the fixer from this link: [Fixer](https://www.moddb.com/games/battle-for-midd...-startup-fixxer). Download, open it and click fix BFME2. If your game still crashes on loading screen, follow these steps: [BFMEII No-CD Guide](https://www.gamereplays.org/community/index.php?showtopic=1000430).
5. Install a multiplayer platform. You can install Gameranger, the most popular multiplayer platform from this link: [Gameranger](https://www.gameranger.com/download/). Download and create an account. Then just host a game in BFME2 and play. If you don't understand GameRanger, here's a guide: < 0f148eb4a0

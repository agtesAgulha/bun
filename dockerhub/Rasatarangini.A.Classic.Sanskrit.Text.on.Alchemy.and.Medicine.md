One of the main features of Rasatarangini is its extensive use of quotations from earlier sources, both alchemical and non-alchemical. The text cites more than 200 works by over 100 authors, some of whom are well-known figures in Indian literature and science, such as Nagarjuna, Bhartrihari, Vagbhata, Sushruta, Charaka, Patanjali, Kalidasa, Bhavabhuti, and Bhoja. The text also incorporates verses from the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Puranas, the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, and other classical texts.
 
Rasatarangini is not only a valuable source of information on alchemy and medicine in medieval India, but also a literary masterpiece that showcases the poetic skill and erudition of its author. The text is written in elegant and refined Sanskrit verse, with various figures of speech, metaphors, similes, alliterations, puns, and rhetorical devices. The text also displays a deep knowledge of various branches of learning, such as grammar, logic, philosophy, astronomy, astrology, mathematics, music, art, and history.
